# Inheritance

In OOP, Classes can obtain a behaviour of another class.
When a class inherits from another, this class is referred to as a child class. 
The child class can only inherit public and protected properties and methods.
That means the child class now has it's own properties and methods together with the ones it's inheriting from the Parent or Base class. 
This makes OOP a useful Programming Paradigm. As it highly encourages code resuse as opposed to reinventing the wheel.
