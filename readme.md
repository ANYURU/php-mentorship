## Folder Structure

The PHP programming sessions are organized into two levels: level 1 and level 2. 
These levels are subdirectories of the `classes` directory, which contains information about the programming sessions.
The `projects` directory is a sibling to the `classes` directory and contains projects that you do in the classes.
The folder structure looks like this:
```
php-mentorship
├── classes
│   ├── level-1
│   └── level-2
└── projects
    ├── project-1
    ├── project-2
    └── project-3
```

## Level 1

Level 1 covers the basics of PHP programming, including:

- [x] Basic syntax
- [x] Control structures
- [x] Functions
- [x] Arrays
- [x] Strings

## Level 2

Level 2 covers more advanced topics in PHP programming, including:
- [x] File handling
- [x] Database connectivity
- [ ] Object-oriented programming in PHP 

## Usage

To use the PHP programming sessions, simply navigate to the appropriate directory in the `classes` directory and open the PHP files in a code editor. The projects in the `projects` directory are self-contained and can be run by opening the project directory in a code editor and running any necessary scripts.

## Resources

The PHP programming sessions were created using a variety of resources, including:
