## Folder Structure

The PHP programming sessions are organized into two levels: level 1 and level 2. 
These levels are subdirectories of the `classes` directory, which contains information about the programming sessions.
The `projects` directory is a sibling to the `classes` directory and contains projects that you do in the classes.
The folder structure looks like this:
```
php-programming-sessions
├── classes
│   ├── level-1
│   └── level-2
└── projects
    ├── project-1
    ├── project-2
    └── project-3
```

## Level 1

Level 1 covers the basics of PHP programming, including:

- Basic syntax
- Control structures
- Functions
- Arrays
- Strings
- File handling

## Level 2

Level 2 covers more advanced topics in PHP programming, including:

- Object-oriented programming in PHP
- Web development with PHP
- Using PHP frameworks
- Database connectivity

## Usage

To use the PHP programming sessions, simply navigate to the appropriate directory in the `classes` directory and open the PHP files in a code editor. The projects in the `projects` directory are self-contained and can be run by opening the project directory in a code editor and running any necessary scripts.

## Resources

The PHP programming sessions were created using a variety of resources, including:

- Online resources and live class tutorials [@davidofug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxNzlS3Wdgo&list=PLfVJE98_X5wdvhjBI_64HUXSLLpov9r3L) youtube
